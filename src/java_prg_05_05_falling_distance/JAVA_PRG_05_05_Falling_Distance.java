/**

 * @author bluebackdev
 * When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be
 * used to determine the distance the object falls in a specific time period:
 * 
 *      d = 1/2 * gt^2
 * 
 * The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in meters,
 * g is 9.8, and t is the amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been
 * falling.
 * 
 * Write a method named fallingDistance that accepts an object's falling time
 * (in seconds) as an argument. The method should return the distance, in
 * meters, that the object has fallen during that time interval. Demonstrate
 * the method by calling it in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as
 * arguments, and displays the return value.
